# RIPS_autograder
Source code for https://ionic.shinyapps.io/rips_autograder/

A circular logic checker I developed using the Shiny and igraph R libraries. Intended for use by counselors at Honors Summer Math Camp to streamline grading RIPS (Reduced Inventory Problem Set) solutions. RIPS  is a collection of set theory statements, from which the student is supposed to either assume as an axiom or prove as a theorem, and the goal is to minimize the number of axioms.
